Here are some of the projects I've completed as a student at UCSB:

* [Fire Scars from the 2017 Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura](https://github.com/silkieMoth/2017-Thomas-Fire-Analysis)
* [The Biodiverisity Intactness Index and Biodiveristy Decline in Phoenix, AZ](https://github.com/silkieMoth/phoenix-biodiversity-intactness)
* [Creation of A Habitat Suitability Map Function for the California Coast](https://github.com/silkieMoth/UCSB-EDS-223-Fisheries-Habitat-Suitability)
* [Houston 2021 Blackout Analysis](https://github.com/silkieMoth/UCSB-EDS-223-Houston-Blackout-Analysis)


* [Remote Sensing of Defensible Space Compliance to Enhance Wildfire Preparedness](https://github.com/wildfire-prep)
  + This project was an investigation into the possibility of building a machine learning model to predict compliance with defensible space rules in Santa Barbara County
  + The models were based off of 5 years of Santa Barbara County Fire Department parcel inspections data, as well as variables like NDVI, rainfall, land use, past compliance status, and random convolutional features.
