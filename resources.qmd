### **Projects**


#### [Remote Sensing of Defensible Space Compliance to Enhance Wildfire Preparedness](https://github.com/wildfire-prep)
**Other Contributors**

* [Rachel Swick](https://github.com/rfswick)
* [Ryan Green](https://github.com/ryangreen6)
* [Leilanie Rubinstein](https://github.com/leirubinstein)

**Description**

* This project was an investigation into the possibility of building a machine learning model to predict compliance with defensible space rules in Santa Barbara County
* The models were based off of 5 years of Santa Barbara County Fire Department parcel inspections data, as well as variables like NDVI, rainfall, land use, past compliance status, and random convolutional features.
