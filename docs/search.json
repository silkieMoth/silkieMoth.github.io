    "text": "Bees and other pollinators are extremely valuable for the ecosystem services they provide. Yet, throughout the past few decades, they have declined in both population and biodiversity (Goulson et al, 2015). Attributed factors are invasive parasites (Meeus et al, 2011), climate change (Soroye, Newbold, & Kerr, 2020), habitat destruction (and fragmentation (Aizen & Feinsinger, 1994), and pesticide use (Arena & Sgolastra, 2014).\nSeveral factor’s make California an ideal microcosm to analyze the effect of pesticides on bee biodiversity. * The state’s 1989 Food Safety Act requires uniquely high standards for reporting (California DPR, 2023). Pesticide use datasets out of CA are therefore large and highly detailed. * CA is size means it has many different ecosystems contained within the same political boundaries. * CA is a agricultural hotspot in the country, meaning there are areas of intensive pesticide use.\nTherefore in this analysis, we will be analyzing pesticide use. Later, we introduce another variable, land cover, to see if there is a significant effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreation of two error models\n\nA two variable model between biodiversity and pesticide use.\nAn extrapolation of the previous model with an added predictor of land cover.\n\nDiagnosing spatial autocorrelation in our models by running a lag model on the residuals and finding Moran’s I.\nA hypothesis test for the affect of land cover on the model where we rejected the null.\n\n\n\n\nAll code for this project can be accessed here."

    "text": "Reflection\nWhile I hypothesized that we would see a significant effect between biodiversity and pesticide use, we didn’t. There are several possible reasons for this.\n\nComplexity of ecological forces\n\n\nWhile it remains true that bee populations are in decline, it’s also a somewhat complicated topic. For one, not all bee species are equally vulnerable. Bumblebee’s longer flight ranges and bigger bodies allow them to tough out the dredge of a long flight from one isolate habitat patch to another and the toxicity of pesticides better than honeybees do (Greenleaf et al, 2007). Furthermore, bees have shown to have a significant amount of phenotypic plasticity, in which they are able to modify their behavior according to their environment (Corona, Libbrecht, & Wheeler, 2016). Furthermore, a significant amount of invasive pressure comes from other bees - the European Honeybee.\n\n\nAnalysis biases\n\n\nPoor data precision\n\nDisappointingly, the pesticide data, in spite of all it’s detail, did not have a column on it in order to join with the shapefile that came with it by township. This possibly affected the results of this analysis, as all the data, even if it was originally in great detail, had to be aggregated up to the county level.\n\nThe hypothesis test was notable as it was likely flawed. For one, I was not able to use an error model due to a strange error in the hypothesis test. Secondly, my p-statistic was suspiciously low.\n\n\nData biases\n\n\nUneven distribution of data points\n\nBig Bee, a database that contains data from a multitude of sources is unlikely to have it’s data be distributed evenly in space for if no other reason that data is more likely to be collected where people already are. It has many different partner and sources but it also collects research grade iNaturalist observations meaning it’s possible there will be less observations out in the middle of the desert and more in a popular park and picnic spot."

    "text": "Possible Next Steps\nBee ecology and decline is a complex topic and there is still much left to learn. Ways I could continue this analysis include…\n\nRefine this analysis and correct possible mistakes\n\n\nThere are a multitude of ways this analysis could be improved.\n\nHow do we visualize the pesticide data with more precision? It’s possible there is something I missed, and the CA DPR may be able to help. Being about to accomplish this could lead to more interesting results than the ones obtained here.\nAnother possibility is to apply a logistic regression model to the land_cover variable. Because it’s the variable that appears to be most significantly correlated, it could be investigated further. Because it is such a high resolution dataset with many different land types, it may warrant it’s own analysis.\n\n\n\nInvestigate other variables\n\n\nVariables such as the influence of parasites and climate change are things that weren’t at all included in this analysis. Invasive parasites have been cited as being a notable contributor to colony collapse disorder (Meeus et al, 2011), and climate change continues to have it’s own negative effects (Soroye, Newbold, & Kerr, 2020).\n\n\nPossible interactions with non-bee factors\n\n\nThe environment is confusing and wild, and nothing will ever make sense to us but that makes it all the more beautiful. Of course, this won’t stop us from trying. Is sea level rise affecting a particular taxa’s favorite flower? Is there some stochastic connection between bee activity and monarch migration? These are things we can only know if they’re investigated."
