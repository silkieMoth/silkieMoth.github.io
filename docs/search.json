    "section": "About",
    "text": "About\n\n\n\nHelicopter surveys wildfire damage in CA\n\n\nForest fires are a whale in the California ecosystem with 7,668 wildland fires occurring each year (CAL FIRE, 2024) with the impacts of wildfires becoming greater with climate change (McKenzie et al., 2004).  The Thomas Fire was a wildfire that was particularly notable for it’s sheer size. In 2017 when it burned through 281,893, it asserted itself as the largest CA wildfire in history at the time. To this day, even as wildfires increase in severity, it still remains the 8th largest wildfire to date as of December 4, 2024.  The goal of this analysis is to map the impact of the 2017 Thomas Fire relative to the rest of Santa Barbara County. Because the fire left a ‘scar’ that is visible from space, it shows up in satellite imagery. Landsat data can capture this damage, as the infrared reluctance of burned land is high.\nCross-referencing the Thomas Fire perimeter and the Landsat imagery allows us to visualize the scar left behind. Furthermore, we can see the effect of the fire on air quality by visualizing the AQI (Air Quality Index) in the region. AQI is a measure of air quality as it relates to human health, with a focus on O3, PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, and NO2."

Because vegetation reflects green light, one can make out somewhat where the vegetation is or isn’t. However, the 2017 Thomas Fire damage is hardly visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis false color raster plots short-wave infrared and near infrared on the red and green colors respectively. By utilizing infrared light reflectance, the difference between the vegetation rich areas and the vegetation poor areas becomes significantly more distinct. The Thomas Fire damage is now distinctly visible, as SWIR reflects greatly under recently burned areas, and NIR reflects best under healthy vegetation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot depicts that the 2017 Thomas Fire correlated with a sudden and extreme rise in the AQI. The baseline state of the AQI in Santa Barbara is hovering around a range of about 30 to 120. When the Thomas Fire occured in December 2017, the AQI jumped to over 300 at it’s peak."
