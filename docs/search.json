    "section": "About",
    "text": "About\n\n\n\nHelicopter surveys wildfire damage in CA\n\n\nForest fires are a whale in the California ecosystem with 7,668 wildland fires occurring each year (CAL FIRE, 2024) with the impacts of wildfires becoming greater with climate change (McKenzie et al., 2004).  The Thomas Fire was a wildfire that was particularly notable for it’s sheer size. In 2017 when it burned through 281,893, it asserted itself as the largest CA wildfire in history at the time. To this day, even as wildfires increase in severity, it still remains the 8th largest wildfire to date as of November 30, 2024.  The goal of this analysis is to map the impact of the 2017 Thomas Fire relative to the rest of Santa Barbara County. Because the fire left a ‘scar’ that is visible from space, it shows up in satellite imagery. Landsat data can capture this damage, as the infrared reluctance of burned land is high.\nCross-referencing the Thomas Fire perimeter and the Landsat imagery allows us to visualize the scar left behind."

However, the 2017 Thomas Fire damage is hardly visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis false color raster plots short-wave infrared and near infrared on the red and green colors respectively. By utilizing infrared light reflectance, the difference between the vegetation rich areas and the vegetation poor areas becomes significantly more distinct. The Thomas Fire damage is now distinctly visible, as SWIR reflects greatly under recently burned areas, and NIR reflects best under healthy vegetation."
