    "Forest fires are a whale in the California ecosystem with 7,668 wildland fires occurring each year (CAL FIRE, 2024) with the impacts of wildfires becoming greater with climate change (McKenzie et al., 2004). </br>\n",
    "The Thomas Fire was a wildfire that was particularly notable for it's sheer size. In 2017 when it burned through 281,893, it asserted itself as the largest CA wildfire in history at the time. To this day, even as wildfires increase in severity, it still remains the 8~th~ largest wildfire to date as of {{< meta date >}}. </br>\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to map the impact of the 2017 Thomas Fire relative to the rest of Santa Barbara County. Because the fire left a 'scar' that is visible from space, it shows up in satellite imagery. Landsat data can capture this damage, as the infrared reluctance of burned land is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-referencing the Thomas Fire perimeter and the Landsat imagery allows us to visualize the scar left behind. Furthermore, we can see the effect of the fire on air quality by visualizing the AQI (Air Quality Index) in the region. AQI is a measure of air quality as it relates to human health, with a focus on O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>.\n",
