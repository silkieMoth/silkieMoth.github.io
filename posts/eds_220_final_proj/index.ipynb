    "Forest fires are a whale in the California ecosystem with 7,668 wildland fires occurring each year (CAL FIRE, 2024) with the impacts of wildfires becoming greater with climate change (McKenzie et al., 2004). </br>\n",
    "The Thomas Fire was a wildfire that was particularly notable for it's sheer size. In 2017 when it burned through 281,893, it asserted itself as the largest CA wildfire in history at the time. To this day, even as wildfires increase in severity, it still remains the 8~th~ largest wildfire to date as of {{< meta date >}}. </br>\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to map the impact of the 2017 Thomas Fire relative to the rest of Santa Barbara County. Because the fire left a 'scar' that is visible from space, it shows up in satellite imagery. Landsat data can capture this damage, as the infrared reluctance of burned land is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-referencing the Thomas Fire perimeter and the Landsat imagery allows us to visualize the scar left behind.\n",

    "## Highlights of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {center-text}\n",
    "* Subsetting of of CA fire perimeter dataset\n",
    "    + Selected for 2017 Thomas Fire\n",
    "    + Saved out to new shapefile\n",
    "* Initial processing of Landsat imagery\n",
    "    + NetCDF file only had one band\n",
    "        - Therefore, utilizing `squeeze()` and `drop_vars`,the 'band' dimension was removed\n",
    "* Mapping of the Landsat imagery in true color\n",
    "    + The red, green, and blue bands were fitted accordingly\n",
    "* False color mapping of Landsat imagery with infrared\n",
    "    + Plotting with infrared in colored bands allows visualization of Thomas Fire damage\n",
    "        - Short-wave infrared in red band\n",
    "            * SWIR's reflectance correlates with moisture in plants and soil. A dry environment like a newly burned forest will reflect greatly.\n",
    "        - Near Infrared in green band\n",
    "            * This is useful for analysis as much like plants reflect green light, they reflect NIR very strongly, particularly healthy vegetation.\n",
