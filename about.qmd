## What I do for fun

I love whenever I can get some time with my guitar, maybe with some paper and a pencil to stretch my creative side. I also love trying things I've never tried before, or getting outside and exploring places I have never seen or been to.

Anyone is free to reach out if they ever want to go hiking or rock climbing!
