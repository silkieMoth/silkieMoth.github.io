Hi there! Iâ€™m Joshua. I just recently graduated from the Master's of Environmental Data Science program with the Bren School @ UCSB. But I also like bugs, music, hiking, rock climbing, and all the cool stuff.

Outside of work, you can catch me trying to wandering aimlessly around some chunk of wilderness or trying to write a song on my guitar.

Feel Free to Explore my website if you are interested in my work!

### I'm currently looking to be hired!

I've worked all over the country, from my undergrad right along the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, to my home state of NJ, to landlocked Colorado, arid Nevada, high altitude AZ and UT, currently ending up in SoCal at the pacific coasts.

I also have a lot of experience in Python, R, SQL, ArcGIS Pro, and Airtable.

#### Send me questions and inquiries at the below links if interested!
